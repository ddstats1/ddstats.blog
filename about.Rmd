Welcome to my personal website!

I'm an active member with Pittsburgh DSA, as well as an avid reader. -- . and the like. Some of the books I've read are on [my Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/99495477-daniel-dulaney?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read) -- my favorite topics/genres include history, politics, and sci-fi
